<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>I am going to implement an application that predicts stock price. It would involve using neural network and I will parallelize the training process using multi-core cpu platforms/clusters. </p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>The training process for neural network has good potential for speedup. A neural network is usually composed of number of neurons separated into multiple levels. Matrix multiplication is usually involved in calculating weights for each neuron. In addition, when using backward propagation algorithm, at each layer, neurons are usually independent from each other. Therefore, we could compute weights for these independent neurons in parallel. Therefore, with large amount of data, we should see a significant speedup after we parallelized the training process.  </p>

<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>

<p>There are a few challenges when trying to parallelize the training process. </p>

<ul>
<li>When using backward propagation, we need to make sure each cpu completes jobs layer by layer. </li>
<li>Since we can get real time quotes for stock price, if we want to exploit this fact, we need to make sure each node has same up-to-date copy of data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>For this project, I will use Lateday clusters to carry out the training process. Yahoo API will help me to obtain real-time stock quotes. Lastly, there are a few paper that talks about either stock prediction using Neural Networks or parallelizing Neural Networks training.</p>

<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Plan to achieve:</strong> 
⋅⋅1. A program that emits stock price prediction about every second. It also displays actual stock price on the side.
⋅⋅2. speed up that is close to linear in terms of number of nodes in the training process. I believe this can be done since the workload for calculating the weights for each neuron should be similar. 
⋅⋅3. fairly accurate prediction of stock price for the next minute.
⋅⋅4. a graph that shows prediction vs actual data</li>
<li>
<strong>Hope to achieve:</strong> 
⋅⋅1. High accuracy prediction.
⋅⋅2. Linear speed up or more than linear speed up.</li>
</ul>

<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>

<p>I will use Latedays machine to help me speed up the training process. And I will use C++ as the language because I am planning to experiment SIMD and OpenMP. Latedays are powerful cluster that allows me to split tasks across nodes. SIMD and OpenMp would be helpful when performing matrix multiplcation. </p>
